Like many of Shafak’s other books, the narrative transcends time and borders to offer an intricate, profound and often moving examination into the trauma women are subjected to at the hands of the patriarchy.</p><p>As well as writing fiction, Shafak writes and speaks about international politics, far-right populism, pluralism, women’s rights and democracy. She is an outspoken critic of the Turkish government, and last year her novels became a target for “crimes of obscenity”; fearing arrest, Shafak has since been living in self-imposed exile in London.</p><p>She will be joining us to talk about her career as a writer, as well as her activism, the importance of free speech, and art as an antidote to political uncertainty.</p></div></div></div>\n"
